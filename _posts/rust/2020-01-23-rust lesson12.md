## Enums in Rust

Enums in Rust are similar to enums in other languages, but with added flexibility. They can be extended with `impl` blocks like structs and are commonly used for nullable variable declarations, making them highly versatile.

Let's explore their functionality through examples.

```rust
enum Language {
  KOREAN,
  ENGLISH
}

fn main() {
  let default_lang = Language::KOREAN;
}
```

### Struct-like Enum Variants

Enums can encapsulate data similar to structs:

```rust
enum Language {
    KOREAN(String),
    ENGLISH(String)
}

fn main() {
  let default_lang = Language::KOREAN(String::from("Korea"));
}
```

### Tuple-like Enum Variants

Enums can also hold tuple-like data:

```rust
enum Language {
    KOREAN(String, i32),
    ENGLISH(String, i32)
}

fn main() {
  let default_lang = Language::KOREAN(String::from("Korea"), 82);
}
```

### Complex Data Structures within Enums

Enums can accommodate various data models:

```rust
enum Book {
  UNKNOWN,
  WRITE { country: String, code: u32 },
  READ (String),
  PICTURE (i32)
  
}
```

### Implementing Methods with `impl`

Enums can have methods defined using `impl`:

```rust
impl Book {
  fn Buy(&self) {
  
  }
}
```

## Option Type

The `Option` type is used for declaring variables that can have a null value. It's an enum with two variants: `Some(T)` for a value present and `None` for a null value.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

let x: Option<i8> = Some(10);
let y = None;
```

Like nullable variables in other languages, `Option` variables cannot be directly used in operations with non-`Option` variables.

This leads to a compilation error, as demonstrated below.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 10;
  let y = Some(10);
  let sum = x + y;
}

//Result
  |
4 | let sum = x + y;
  |                    ^ no implementation for `i8 + std::option::Option<i8>`
  |
   = help: the trait `std::ops::Add<std::option::Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`
```
