# Rust Installation and Project Management

[Installation Guide - Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

This document outlines the necessary steps to install Rust and introduces Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager.

## 1. **Rust Compiler (rustc)**

### 1.1. **Installation**

To install the Rust compiler:

- Windows: Execute the `rustup-init.exe` installer.
- Linux/macOS: Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

The `rustc` compiler is the core component for compiling Rust code.

### 1.2. **Environment Variable Configuration (Windows)**

On Windows, ensure that the following path is added to your system's environment variables:

```
    %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
```

This step enables you to execute Rust binaries from the command line.

## 2. **Cargo: The Rust Build System and Package Manager**

Cargo is the primary tool for managing Rust projects. It simplifies tasks such as building code and managing dependencies.

### 2.1. **Verify Cargo Installation**

Confirm that Cargo is installed correctly by running:

```bash
    cargo --version
```

This command will display the installed Cargo version.

### 2.2. **Create a New Project**

To create a new Rust project, use the following command:

```bash
    cargo new hello_cargo
```

This command generates a new directory named `hello_cargo` containing the project structure.  A `Cargo.toml` file will be created.

The `Cargo.toml` file is the manifest file for Rust projects, similar to `package.json` in Node.js projects. It defines project metadata and dependencies. TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is the configuration file format used by Cargo.

### 2.3. **Build the Project**

Build the project using one of the following methods:

```bash
    cargo build (--release)
```

Or, alternatively:

```bash
    rustc main.rs
```

The `cargo build` command compiles the project.  The `--release` flag enables production optimizations. You can also compile directly with `rustc`.

### 2.4. **Run the Executable**

Execute the compiled binary using:

```bash
    cargo run
```

Alternatively, run the executable directly:

```bash
    ./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

The compiled executable is located in the `/target/debug/` directory.

### 2.5. **Check the Project**

To perform a quick check for errors without building an executable, use:

```bash
    cargo check
```

This command performs a faster analysis than `cargo build` and is useful for quickly identifying potential issues.
