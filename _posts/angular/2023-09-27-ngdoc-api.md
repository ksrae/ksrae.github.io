# Generating API Documentation in Angular Applications

This document outlines how to automatically generate API documentation within your Angular applications. We'll leverage `@ng-doc/builder` and `@ng-doc/core` to streamline this process.

## 1. Installation

To begin, install the `@ng-doc/builder` package using the Angular CLI. This builder facilitates the API documentation generation.

```
ng add @ng-doc/builder
```

## 2. Model File Creation

Define the model files that you want to include in your API documentation. For instance, create a `sample.model.ts` file with the following structure:

```tsx
export interface ISample {
  key: string;
  value: string;
}

export interface ISam {
  key: string;
  value: string;
}

export enum TEST {
  NONE = 0,
  ONE = 1,
  TWO = 2
}

export type TType = {
  key: string;
  value: string;
}
```

This file defines interfaces, enums, and types that will be reflected in your API documentation.

## 3. API Configuration File Creation

Create an API configuration file (e.g., `ng-doc.api.ts`) to configure the documentation generation process. This configuration is utilized by `@ng-doc/core`.

```tsx
import { NgDocApi } from '@ng-doc/core';
import GettingStartedCategory from './getting-started/ng-doc.category';

const Api: NgDocApi = {
  title: 'API Documentation',
  category: GettingStartedCategory,
  scopes: [
    {
      name: 'example-library', // Scope name
      route: 'examlibrary', // Route path
      include: 'src/app/sample.model.ts', // Model file path to include
    },
  ],
};

export default Api;
```

Within the `scopes` array, specify the paths to your model files and other relevant information for documentation generation. Each scope represents a distinct section in your API documentation.

## 4. API Documentation Generation

After creating the API configuration file and completing the settings, execute the following command to generate the API documentation:

```
ng generate @ng-doc/builder:api
```

This command triggers the `@ng-doc/builder` to parse your code and generate the documentation based on your configuration.

## 5. Verification

Once the API documentation is generated, you can access it within your Angular application. For example, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/api/examlibrary` in your browser to view the API documentation.<br/>

<br/>


The generated API documentation automatically lists information related to the model files you've defined. This approach extends beyond interfaces; you can also document services, components, and other elements in a similar manner.<br/><br/>

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and provide comprehensive API documentation for your Angular applications, benefiting developers and promoting code maintainability.
