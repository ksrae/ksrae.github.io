Let's explore several methods for importing external JavaScript files within TypeScript. A few years ago, TypeScript was relatively unknown. However, spearheaded by Angular, its adoption has surged in recent years, becoming a mainstream choice for React, Vue.js, and even Node.js projects.

However, a key challenge arises: existing JavaScript files cannot be directly used. To enable TypeScript to understand JavaScript code, a definition file, known as `d.ts`, is necessary. We'll walk through creating these definition files with a simple example and explore methods to automate their generation.

## Handling npm Package Imports

When importing external libraries through npm, utilizing `@types` provides a straightforward solution. Adding this prefix during installation generates a `d.ts` file within the `node_modules/@types` directory.

```
npm install @types/[filename]
```

For instance, when importing `qrcode.js` via npm, install both `qrcode` and `@types/qrcode`.

```
npm install qrcode @types/qrcode
```

This process creates `node_modules/@types/qrcode`. Examining the `index.d.ts` file reveals the automatically generated TypeScript-compatible code.

```tsx
// Type definitions for qrcode 1.3
// Project: http://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode
// Definitions by: York Yao <https://github.com/plantain-00>
//                 Michael Nahkies <https://github.com/mnahkies>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped

/// <reference types="node" />

import * as stream from "stream";

export type QRCodeErrorCorrectionLevel = "low" | "medium" | "quartile" | "high" | "L" | "M" | "Q" | "H";

export interface QRCodeOptions {
    /**
     * QR Code version. If not specified the more suitable value will be calculated.
     */
    version?: number;
    /**
     * Error correction level.
     * Possible values are low, medium, quartile, high or L, M, Q, H.
     * Default: M
     */
    errorCorrectionLevel?: QRCodeErrorCorrectionLevel;
    /**
     * Helper function used internally to convert a kanji to its Shift JIS value.
     * Provide this function if you need support for Kanji mode.
     */
    toSJISFunc?: (codePoint: string) => number;
}

export interface QRCodeToDataURLOptions extends QRCodeRenderersOptions {
    /**
     * Data URI format.
     * Default: image/png
     */
    type?: "image/png" | "image/jpeg" | "image/webp";
    rendererOpts?: {
        /**
         * A Number between 0 and 1 indicating image quality if the requested type is image/jpeg or image/webp.
         * Default: 0.92
         */
        quality?: number;
    };
}
//... (Omitted)
```

> When importing the generated `d.ts` file into TypeScript, you can use `import as`.
> 

```tsx
import * as qqq from 'qrcode';
...
ngOnInit(){
 let qrcodeTest: qqq.QRCode = qqq.create('Qrcode Create Test', <qqq.QRCodeOptions>{
   errorCorrectionLevel: 'H'
 });
}
```

> Alternatively, you can use the traditional import method. However, be mindful that this approach can lead to naming conflicts if the exported function name clashes with existing function names.
> 

```tsx
import {create, QRCode, QRCodeOptions} from 'qrcode';
...
  ngOnInit() {
    const qrcodeTest: QrCode = create('ttt', <QRCodeOptions> {
      errorCorrectionLevel: 'H'
    });
  }
```

## Handling Non-npm JavaScript Files

In scenarios where npm installation isn't employed, manual creation of definition files becomes necessary. The procedure is as follows:

- Add `module.exports` to the JavaScript file.
- Create a `d.ts` file.
- Call it from TypeScript.

Consider the following `test.js` file:

```jsx
function test1(){
    return test2('test1');
}

function test2(str){
    return 'test2' + str;
}
```

Add `module.exports` to this file. Ensure you include only the values you intend to export, structured as an Object. While the export keys can be named freely, avoid conflicts with built-in function names or other functions. Although potential conflicts can be resolved using `import as`, preventing them minimizes the risk of errors. If a function accepts parameters, ensure they are accurately defined.

```jsx
module.exports = {
    testfunction: function(){return test1();},
    aaa: function(str){return test2(str);}
};

function test1(){
    return test2('test1');

}

function test2(str){
    return 'test2' + str;
}
```

The JavaScript file is now prepared for external use. Let's create the `.d.ts` file. The filename doesn't have to match the JavaScript file's name. The core of the `d.ts` file involves importing the JavaScript file and declaring the function names (from the `module.exports` keys) using `declare function`. While somewhat redundant, this step is vital for TypeScript to recognize the functions.

```jsx
import './test.js';

declare function testfunction(): string;
declare function aaa(str): string;
```

That concludes the setup! Let's import this into TypeScript. When importing, specify the path to the `d.ts` file.

```tsx
import * as temp from './test';

ngOnInit(){
  console.log(temp.testfunction(), temp.aaa('this.is test'));
}
```
